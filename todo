Doubly Linked List using a single pointer

spiral traversal in binary tree approach1: using matrix store the tree level wise and then print rows in alternate order.. approach2: first find height of tree and then keep i&j for levels, print levels in alternate order and i++ j-- 

ternary search is not better than binary search??
